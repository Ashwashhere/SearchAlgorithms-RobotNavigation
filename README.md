# SearchAlgorithms-RobotNavigation
This project is a technical evaluation of heuristic and uninformed search strategies for robotic navigation in complex grid environments. It utilizes a custom-built Maze Search Visualizer to benchmark the performance of pathfinding algorithms against environmental constraints.
